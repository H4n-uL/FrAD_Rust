## Coverage

This licence applies to the Work as a whole, plus the copyright in Fourier Analogue-in-Digital, etc.

## Warranty

Fourier Analogue-in-Digital (hereinafter FrAD) is distributed as is.

Any repository implementing FrAD MUST be fully compatible with the [official FrAD format document](https://mikhael-openworkspace.notion.site/Format-specs-727affae8db043f2b50372d91d534368?pvs=4).

## About Redistribution or Reimplementation

When redistributing or reimplementing FrAD, the following must be observed.

### Common provisions

- There is no obligation to release source code, but it is recommended unless it is utilised as part of commercial software or contains patent-protected technology.
- If you reimplement it as open source, you must use this licence as is, but you can add attribution to the author.

### Distribution

- You cannot charge end consumers any royalties for distributing this repository, its source code, or official documentation.

### Reimplementation

- Contributors or third-party developers are welcome to create software compatible with FrAD and use it for any purpose, non-commercial or commercial. The original author does not require any royalties for this.
- The original author reserves the right to certify compliance with the FrAD format and may, in some cases, request the source code.
- After the source code has been reviewed, and at the request of the developer, the original author must destroy any source code stored on the original author's device without delay.

## About Contributions

The Project Lead is the general manager of FrAD and sets the direction of the project and has final decision-making authority. Contributors provide suggestions and make technical contributions for the development of FrAD.

Contributors have moral rights to their contributions, with the same effect as the original authors. Accordingly, an infringement of the moral rights of any one Contributor shall be deemed an infringement of the moral rights of all Contributors. Contributions automatically constitute acceptance of the rights and obligations under this licence.

Disputes between Contributors shall be resolved by mutual agreement. If agreement cannot be reached, the Project Lead will arbitrate. If either party is dissatisfied with the outcome of the arbitration, they may take the matter to court.

Disputes between the Project Lead and a Contributor may only arise from a breach of the Licence by the Contributor, in which case the Project Lead may take the sanctions set out in the Licence.

## Intellectual Property Rights

FrAD is without intellectual property rights. All original repository code, technology, and ideas developed by FrAD devteam cannot be claimed as intellectual property rights such as patents, trademarks, or design rights.

However, for add-ons or plug-ins developed by third parties, independent intellectual property rights are guaranteed for those features only, regardless of the Archivist Licence.

## Licence Violations

After confirming that one or more of the conditions below has been met, the original author will notify the user of the violation and will request it to be resolved. The grace period is three periods of one month each, totalling three months.

1. Standalone commercial use of this repository without any enhancements is prohibited. Honestly, even the craziest of crazies wouldn't buy some grotesque source that might have malware instead of the official public repository, but it's prohibited anyway.
2. You are not required to credit the original author of the project. However, it is prohibited for third parties who have not contributed to the project to claim that they are the copyright holder of the project. If you have contributed, you may list the original author and the names of the contributors.
3. Claiming intellectual property rights over FrAD is prohibited.
4. Commercial use of FrAD's official documents is strictly prohibited. All official documents must be distributed free of charge and made accessible to all consumers.
5. Obfuscation of end-consumer products is strictly prohibited unless security is more important than preservation, such as for internet/voice communications or disk encryption. It is unacceptable to apply technologies that interfere with the legitimate rights of consumers to FrAD, a format that is open to all.

If the violation is not resolved and the grace period has elapsed, the user will be immediately listed on FrAD's blacklist and the original author will notify them of the blacklisting.

Once blacklisted, the user will lose all access to FrAD. This includes, but is not limited to, viewing, distributing, or selling end-consumer products that are in violation of the licence, encoders, decoders, etc.

Continued use of FrAD without resolving the violation will be considered a massive infringement of moral rights and may result in immediate legal action.

### Unblacklisting

Once you fix the licence violation and pass the unblacklisting review, you will be immediately removed from the FrAD blacklist.

## Disclaimer

The original author and contributors are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages resulting from the use of this work except to the extent that liability is acknowledged.

## Priority between licence languages

In case of a dispute between the original author and the consumer, or any violation of the licence by the consumer, the licence in the consumer's native language or a representative equivalent of it shall take priority. However, in the event of a dispute between consumers, and if there is a conflict between the licences or their interpretation, the Korean licence shall take priority.
